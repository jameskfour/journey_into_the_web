    <div class="css-syntax-container">
        <div class="selectors-container">
            <p><b>Selectors</b> are used to specify elements to apply css rules to.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Universal</b>, or *, specifies elements of any type.</li>
                <li><b>Type selectors</b>, ie p, h1, img, specifies elements of any of the given type.</li>
                <li><b>Class selectors</b>, ie p class="paragraph", allows you to specify any element with the given
                    class. When writing the css rule, the class name must be preceded by a period.</li>
                <li><b>ID selectors</b>, ie p id="first-paragraph", is useful for links to a section on the current
                    page, or for targeting a highly specific element. When writing the css rule, the id name must be
                    preceded by a # sign.</li>
                <li><b>Grouping Selectors</b>, separated by commas, allows you to cut down on repetition in your css
                    rules for common styles.</li>
                <li><b>Chaining Selectors</b>, separated by a period, are for specifying an element that has both of the
                    given classes or IDs.
                </li>
                <li><b>Descendant Combinator</b>, separated by a space, are for specifying the ast selector <b>only</b>
                    if it has a parent with the previous selector.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="properties-container">
            <p><b>Properties</b> refer to how the element will be changed on the page.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>color</b>: can be a color name, HEX, RGB or HSL values.</li>
                <li><b>background-color</b>: follows the same as <b>color</b>.</li>
                <li><b>font-family</b>: can be a single value or a list. If the first font is unsupported, it tries the
                    next, and so on. Typically, end the list with a generic family name like <i>sans-serif</i>.</li>
                <li><b>font-size</b>: measured in px.</li>
                <li><b>font-weight</b>: affects boldness in supported fonts. Accepted alues are keywords or a number
                    between 1 and 1000.</li>
                <li><b>text-align</b>: use center, right or left, preceded by a colon, to align as desired.</li>
                <li><b>height and width regarding images</b>, using "auto" for height, and adjusting the width to scale
                    proportionately. It is best to be included regardless of adjustments to reserve space on the webpage
                    during slow loading to prevent shifting of contents.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>For a list of all properties, see <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference">

    <h4>CSS can be added externally, through a separate file linked in the HTML's header
        with a self closing link element, ie: link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css", where
        "href" is the location of the file, while "rel" specifies the relationship between the HTML file and the linked
        file. Alternatively, CSS can be written internally in the HTML file itself, within a pair of "style" tags.
    </h4>
    <h2 class="css-heading">The Cascade</h2>
    <p><b>The Cascade</b> determines which rules get applied through an ordering of priority. This order is based on:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <b>Specificity</b>, where <b>ID</b> has the highest priority, followed by <b>class</b> and ending with
            <b>type</b>. Additionally, a larger amount of a single selector will beat a smaller amount of the same.
            <b>Universal selectors</b> and <b>Combinators</b> have no specificty in and of themselves, therefore do not
            affect priority.
        </li>
        <li><b>Inheritance</b>, where specifically targeting an element's property overrules an inherited property.</li>
        <li><b>Rule Order</b>, where the last defined rule is the final output.</li>
    </ol>
