        <p>CSS can be added externally, through a separate file linked in the HTML's header 
            with a self closing link element, ie: link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css."
            "href" is the location of the file, while "rel" specifies the relationship between the HTML file and the linked file.
            Alternatively, CSS can be written internally in the HTML file itself, within a pair of "style" tags.
